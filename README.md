# To Deploy infrastructure in azure, you have to do the following steps
# Getting Started with Terraform and Azure
## Step 1: Install Terraform
- Download and install Terraform for your operating system from the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
- Follow the installation instructions provided for your platform.
## Step 2: Set Up an Azure Account
- If you don't already have an Azure account, sign up for one at [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
- Create a new Azure Subscription if you don't have an existing one.
## Step 3: Set Up Azure CLI (Optional)
- Install the Azure CLI for managing Azure services from the command line. You can download it from [Azure CLI Downloads](https://aka.ms/installazurecli).
- Sign in to your Azure account using the command `az login`.
## Step 4: Configure Azure Credentials
- To authenticate Terraform with your Azure account, you can set up a Service Principal or use Azure CLI credentials.
  
  - **Option 1: Using Azure CLI Credentials (Recommended for local development):**
    - Run `az login` to authenticate with your Azure account.
  
  - **Option 2: Using a Service Principal (Recommended for automation):**
    - Create a Service Principal and set the necessary environment variables. You can do this with the Azure CLI or Azure Portal. Here's an example using the CLI:
      ```bash
      az ad sp create-for-rbac --name terraform-sp --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}
      ```
      Set the environment variables:
      ```bash
      export ARM_CLIENT_ID="client_id"
      export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="client_secret"
      export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="subscription_id"
      export ARM_TENANT_ID="tenant_id"
      ```
## Step 5: Initialize and Apply
1. Open a terminal in your project directory.
2. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory. This downloads the Azure provider plugin.
3. Run `terraform plan` to see what changes Terraform will make.
4. If everything looks correct, run `terraform apply` to apply the changes. Confirm with `yes`.
## Step 7: Clean Up (Optional)
When you're finished, you can run `terraform destroy` to delete all resources created by your configuration.
## Additional Resources and info
- [Terraform Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html)
- [Azure Provider Documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs)
Remember, always exercise caution when running `terraform apply` to avoid unintended changes or resource deletions. It's a good practice to start with non-production resources for testing.
**This guide provides a basic overview. As you progress, you can explore more advanced features and best practices. Happy Terraforming!
**Current code structure developed for the azure devops and its not applicable for the other platform, to apply this in another platform, you have to make refactoring.# environments
